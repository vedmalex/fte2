# Demo (Node CJS) using templates from demo/

Build and run:

```bash
./build-and-run.sh
```

- Bundles demo templates from `demo/indent/views` (e.g., `graphql.nhtml`) using the CLI
- Runs the bundled templates with Node CJS runtime
- You can switch to async/stream by using `runAsync`/`runStream` on the factory
