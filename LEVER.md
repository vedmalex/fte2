# LEVER - Reuse Opportunities

## Leverage Existing Patterns
- [ ] [LEV-001] Reuse token/state machine from `packages/fte.js-parser/src/index.ts` to define grammar rules
- [ ] [LEV-002] Reuse trimming behaviors (`trimStartLines`, `trimEndLines`, etc.) as normative semantics in grammar notes
- [ ] [LEV-003] Reuse existing indentation detection from demos (`demo/parser.mjs`) as a baseline for formatter

## Eliminate Duplicates
- [ ] [DUP-001] Consolidate directive list across code and docs to a single source of truth

## Reduce Complexity
- [ ] [COMP-001] Express tag families and states in EBNF to simplify mental model and tests
- [ ] [COMP-002] Unify multi-line templating instructions into single logical blocks during formatting
